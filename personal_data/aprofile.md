# 👋 Hello, I'm Krishna Vamsi Dhulipalla

I’m a **Machine Learning Engineer** with over **3 years of experience** designing and deploying intelligent AI systems, integrating backend infrastructure, and building real-time data workflows. I specialize in **LLM-powered agents**, **semantic search**, **bioinformatics AI models**, and **cloud-native ML infrastructure**.

I earned my **M.S. in Computer Science** from **Virginia Tech** in December 2024 with a 3.95/4.0 GPA, focusing on large language models, intelligent agents, and scalable data systems. My work spans the full ML lifecycle—from research and fine-tuning transformer architectures to deploying production-ready applications on AWS and GCP.

I’m passionate about **LLM-driven systems**, **multi-agent orchestration**, and **domain-adaptive ML**, particularly in **genomic data analysis** and **real-time analytics**.
